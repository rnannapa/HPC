Matrix multiplication using OpenACC

A batch file is included which runs the code for given matrix size.

User have to give the flags for which code to run

if using k80
pgcc -acc -fast -ta=tesla:cc35 matrixMul.c -o matrixMul.out -DSIZE=$j -DCASEnoK

if using p100
pgcc -acc -fast -ta=tesla:cc60 -Minfo=accel matrixMul.c -o matrixMul.out -DSIZE=$j -DCASEK

check the gpu target using pgaccelinfo

The flags are:
CASE0
This is the original code provided, this doesnot have any OpenACC directives

CASEK
This is parallelization using OpenACC kernel directives

CASEnoK
This is parallelization by the user

########

Comments for modification of the code are provides in the .c file.
